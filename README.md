# "Unsupervised Machine Learning with scikit-learn in Python"

## Description:

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing the application of unsupervised machine learning techniques in Python using scikit-learn. In this repository, you'll find a Python script (unsupervised_ml_analysis.py) that explores clustering and dimensionality reduction methods for unsupervised data analysis.

## Features:

K-Means Clustering: Implement and visualize the K-Means clustering algorithm.
Hierarchical Clustering: Explore hierarchical clustering for data grouping.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Understand dimensionality reduction using PCA.
Data Visualization: Utilize matplotlib and seaborn for interactive data visualization.
Evaluation Metrics: Learn how to assess the performance of unsupervised algorithms.

## Requirements:

Python 3.x
scikit-learn library (pip install scikit-learn)
Matplotlib library (pip install matplotlib)
Seaborn library (pip install seaborn)

## Usage:

### Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/unsupervised-ml-analysis.git

### Install required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Run the script:

python unsupervised_ml_analysis.py

Feel free to explore, modify, and use this script as a starting point for your own unsupervised machine learning projects. If you find it helpful, don't forget to ⭐️ the repository!
